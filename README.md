# Multi PDF, excel, URL Question Answering System using LLAMA 3.3
## Overview
This is a Python-based PDF Question Answering (QA) system that allows users to upload multiple PDF files and ask questions about their contents. The application uses advanced natural language processing techniques to extract and retrieve relevant information from the uploaded documents.
## Features
- Multiple PDF, Excel or URL file upload
- Document text extraction and chunking
- Vector-based semantic search
- Question answering using state-of-the-art language model
- Gradio-based web interface for easy interaction

## Technologies Used
- Gradio: Web interface creation
- LangChain: Document processing and QA workflow
- HuggingFace: Embedding generation
- Groq: Large Language Model (LLM) for question answering
- Fiass: Vector store for document embeddings

## How It Works
PDF documents are loaded and split into smaller chunks
Document chunks are converted to vector embeddings
When a query is submitted, semantic similarity search finds relevant document chunks
The language model generates an answer based on the retrieved chunks
